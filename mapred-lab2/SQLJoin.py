This application is a map reduce implementation to implement a SQL Join.

mr = MapReduce.MapReduce()

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# 
#  Application Usage:
#
#      python SQLJoin.py arg-1 arg-2
#
#      arg-1:  File name containing table data for Users table in csv format. 
#              The first row of the file should contain the column names. 
#              The first column of each row should identify the table name. 
#      arg-2:  Same as the arg-1 containing data for the Posts table.
#  
#  The application is hard-coded to implement a SQL statement that answers
#  the following question on the 'Posts" and 'Users' data of stack overflow:
#
#  Is it possible that users with a high reputation (>500) only post difficult
#  to answer questions (low number of answers)?   
#  
#  The SQL statement that would provide data to answer the above question 
#  would be: 
#  SELECT Users.DisplayName,Posts.Title, Posts.AnswerCount, Posts.CommentCount
#  FROM Users,Posts
#  WHERE Users.Id = Posts.OwnerUserId AND
#        Users.Reputation > 500
# 
#  Datasets: ..\datasets\cstheory_sample\Posts_Sample.csv
#            ..\datasets\cstheory_sample\Users_Sample.csv  
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#  
#  Algorithm Design:
#
#  Key Idea: Send matching records from both tables to the same reducer.
#
#  Initial Setup:
#  1. Read the first line of both the input files and store the column names 
#     as a dictionary. The key will be the column name and the value will
#     be it's position in the row.
#     This should be done before calling the execute method of MapReduce
#     The MapReduce module is designed to skip the first line of a CSV file.
#     This should be done for both the tables.
#  Mapper:
#  1. Input:  One line from the file. This will be a list containing the
#             values of each column of a record.
#  2. Key   : For the POSTS table, OwnerUserId
#             For the Users table, Id
#     value : Full record.
#     Do not emit anything if:
#        a. The user Id is NULL in either table.
#        b. Record from post table is not a question.
#           A post can be a question or an answer. The PostTypeId field 
#           identifies a post as a question or an answer. If the value is "1",
#           it is a question.

#  Reducer:
#     In the list of values available in each reducer, there should be only
#     one list item for the user. The remaining list items will be records
#     from the posts table. Extract the DisplayName and Reputation from the 
#     User record and the Title, AnswerCount and CommentCount from each
#     list item that belongs to the posts table. Emit one line for each item
#     belonging to the posts table. 
#     Do not emit anything is the userReputation is less than 500
#       
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

"""
  Questions:
  1. How would you eliminate rows from the result that do not have any data
     from the posts table?
     
  Extensions:
  1. Extend the algorithm to support:
        a. SQL outer joins.
        b. Multi-Way joins on more than one table. You will need to design
           a way for the user to speicy the join columns for each table.
