  <row Id="2" PostId="2" Score="1" Text="Yes, the language is a bit confusing. It took me some time to realize that the data set consists of n numbers to be sorted but these numbers are arranged in a sqrt(n) x sqrt(n) grid such that each row and each column is already sorted. Is that what you meant?" CreationDate="2010-08-16T20:00:19.490" UserDisplayName="Hans" />

  <row Id="9" PostId="8" Text="In short, you can do an sqrt(N)-way merge, like in mergesort? That was my running best method, but it turns out to be O(N log N)--I don't have an exact constant there, but there's a 0.5 for log(sqrt(N)) at least." CreationDate="2010-08-16T20:50:09.573" UserId="48" />
  <row Id="10" PostId="20" Text="The other answer gives an explicit algorithm with this complexity, so I'll consider this problem solved for 2-D grids and, without actually checking, probably for arbitrary dimension grids." CreationDate="2010-08-16T20:54:45.337" UserId="48" />

  <row Id="14" PostId="19" Score="7" Text="Monads can be used to cordon off imperative programming in a purely functional world, but I can't see the case for claiming that they form a theoretical basis for imperative programming analogous to the relationship between the lambda calculus and many functional languages.&#xA;&#xA;Monads don't model computation so much as they form an abstraction over classes of computation (e.g. pure computation vs. computation that involves IO, or computation that relies on a particular bundle of mutable state)."

Every single CS student discovers this for themselves, and thinks something major is wrong until they are told that everyone knows this but no one talks about it.&#xA;&#xA;Also, wasn't there a brouhaha a couple of years ago when someone exploited the O(log n) model to give a sub-cubic time algorithm for some famous problem that was conjectured to be Omega(n^3)?
